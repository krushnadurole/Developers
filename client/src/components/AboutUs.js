        <h1>Hello Guys !!!</h1>
        <p>
            WE are here to make a good and wide network of vitians 
            so that they Software Developers or any other domain Enginners
            can come up together and build something innovative. 
        </p>
        <h3>From where this idea I got?</h3>
        Actually one day , me and my friend wants to go to a hackathon 
        but for that hackathon we need someone who know blockchain technology very well. 
        and another guy who knows hardware (electronics good enough);

        But we were not able to find them and end up with not partipating in hackathon.
        so we were upset because of this . 
        then I though that there should be a platform on which our 
        college developers can showcase their skills through linkedin kind 
        of profile so that whenerver anyone need some help of any technology then 
        he/she can take help from that guy.

        so if you want to help or get help then  what you are waiting for ?
        go and sign up and immeadiately create your developer profile. 

        soon we are launching a requirement feature in which any one upload 
        the requirements on the platform. so that developer can also reach to 
        the someone who need his help. 
        its just like 
        thursty person going to river or vice versa.
