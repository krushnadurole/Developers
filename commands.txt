frontend part start : npm start
backend part start : npm run dev

installed the date-fns npm module 
to convert the mongodb time stamp 
to human readable date format. 






why i am not taking all the informationa at start. 
because generally no one becomes ready to given infomrationa at start.
unless you know about something how you can trust to it . 
that's why at first we do the user registration . 
then we will give a option to the user to create a developer profile.

what feature will be there in the application : 
1. login and signup
2. Student can add his developer profile. 
3. student can mention his role,contact,email,
description,achievements,resume,etc.
4. All the developers profile will be displayed to the dashboard.
5. Each profile can be viewed by any authorized user. 
6. only vitians are allowed as an authorized user .for now.
7. every profile will have a review and ratings. 
8. every developer can update status : busy in ESE,busy in hackathon ,
i am free ryt now for project work. 
9. About us page.
10. Better UI
