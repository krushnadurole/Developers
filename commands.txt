frontend part start : npm start
backend part start : npm run dev

installed the date-fns npm module 
to convert the mongodb time stamp 
to human readable date format. 













why i am not taking all the informationa at start. 
becuase generally no one becomes ready to given infomrationa at start.
unless you know about something how you can trust to it . 
that's why at first we do the user registration . 
then we will give a option to the user to create a developer profile.
